# GitHub Actions Runner Add-on for Home Assistant

[![GitHub Release][releases-shield]][releases]
![Project Stage][project-stage-shield]

A Home Assistant add-on that runs a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner in a Docker container.

## About

This add-on allows you to run a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner directly within your Home Assistant installation. This is useful when you want to run GitHub Actions workflows on your own infrastructure, with access to your local network and resources.

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store
2. Install the "GitHub Actions Runner" add-on
3. Configure the add-on with your repository URL and runner token
4. Start the add-on

## Configuration

The add-on requires the following configuration options:

### Option: `repo_url` (required)

The URL of the GitHub repository where you want to register the runner.

Example: `https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo`

For organization-level runners, use: `https://github.com/yourorganization`

### Option: `runner_token` (required)

The registration token for the GitHub Actions runner. You can generate this token from:

- **Repository runners**: Go to your repository → Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
- **Organization runners**: Go to your organization → Settings → Actions → Runners → New runner

**Note**: The token is valid for 1 hour after generation, so you need to configure and start the add-on within that time frame.

### Option: `runner_name` (optional)

A custom name for the GitHub Actions runner. This makes it easier to identify your runner in the GitHub UI, especially when managing multiple runners.

Example: `homeassistant-runner-prod` or `ha-runner-01`

If not specified, GitHub will auto-generate a name based on the hostname.

### Option: `debug_logging` (optional)

Enable debug/verbose logging for troubleshooting. When enabled, the add-on will output additional information including:
- Operating system version
- Installed dependency packages
- Runner directory contents
- Runner version information
- Detailed command execution traces

Default: `false`

### Example Configuration

```yaml
repo_url: "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo"
runner_token: "YOUR_RUNNER_TOKEN_HERE"
runner_name: "homeassistant-runner"
debug_logging: false
```

**Note**: The `runner_name` field is optional. If omitted, GitHub will auto-generate a runner name.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository or organization settings
2. Go to Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner
3. Copy the registration token provided
4. Configure this add-on with:
   - Your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo`)
   - The registration token you just copied
5. Start the add-on
6. The runner will appear as online in your GitHub repository/organization
